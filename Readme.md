# connect-memcached

Memcached session store, using [node-memcached](http://github.com/3rd-Eden/node-memcached) for communication with cache server.

## Installation

via npm:

```bash
$ npm install connect-memcached
```

## Example

```javascript
var express = require("express"),
  session = require("express-session"),
  cookieParser = require("cookie-parser"),
  http = require("http"),
  app = express(),
  MemcachedStore = require("connect-memcached")(session);

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "CatOnKeyboard",
    key: "test",
    proxy: "true",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new MemcachedStore({
      hosts: ["127.0.0.1:11211"],
      secret: "123, easy as ABC. ABC, easy as 123" // Encrypt session data
    })
  })
);

app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  if (req.session.views) {
    ++req.session.views;
  } else {
    req.session.views = 1;
  }
  res.send("Viewed <strong>" + req.session.views + "</strong> times.");
});

http.createServer(app).listen(9341, function() {
  console.log("Listening on %d", this.address().port);
});
```

## Options

- `hosts` Memcached servers locations, can be string, array, hash.
- `prefix` An optional prefix for each memcache key, in case you are sharing your memcached servers with something generating its own keys.
- `ttl` An optional parameter used for setting the default TTL (in seconds)
- `secret` An optional secret can be used to encrypt/decrypt session contents.
- `algorithm` An optional algorithm parameter may be used, but must be valid based on returned `crypto.getCiphers()`. The current default is `aes-256-gcm`.
- `hashing` You can specify an alternate hashing algorithm as well; default is `sha512`.
- ... Rest of given option will be passed directly to the node-memcached constructor.

For details see [node-memcached](http://github.com/3rd-Eden/node-memcached).

## Upgrading from v0.x.x -> v1.x.x

If You're upgrading from the pre v1.0.0 version of this library and use encryption for session data be sure to **remove all session entries created with previous version**. 

Upgrading library without taking appropriate action will result in `SyntaxError` exceptions during JSON parsing of decoded entries. 

Sessions without encryption are not affected.
